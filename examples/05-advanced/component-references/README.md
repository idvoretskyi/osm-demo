# Component References Example

This example demonstrates creating components that reference other components, enabling modular architecture patterns.

## Overview

The Component References example shows how to:
- Create library components
- Reference components from other components
- Build complex component hierarchies
- Manage component dependencies

## Files

- `create-reference-example.sh` - Main script that creates component references
- `work/app/` - Application component source
- `work/library/` - Library component source
- `work/utils-component/` - Utility component artifacts
- `work/app-component/` - Main application component with references

## Running the Example

```bash
./create-reference-example.sh
```

## What it demonstrates

- Component-to-component references
- Dependency management in OCM
- Modular component architecture
- Component resolution and retrieval
- Reference validation and integrity

## Use Cases

- Microservice architectures
- Shared library distribution
- Component ecosystem management
- Dependency tracking and updates

This example is crucial for understanding how to build scalable, modular systems with OCM.
