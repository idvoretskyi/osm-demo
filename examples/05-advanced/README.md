# 05-Advanced: Advanced OCM Features

This section demonstrates advanced OCM capabilities including component references and localization.

## Examples in this section:

1. **component-references** - Working with component dependencies and references
2. **localization** - Adapting components for different environments and regions

## Learning Objectives:

- Understand complex component relationships
- Learn about component references and dependencies
- Practice environment-specific adaptations
- Explore advanced OCM features

## Prerequisites:

- OCM CLI installed
- Completion of basic examples (01-basic)
- Understanding of transport concepts (02-transport)
- Knowledge of signing (03-signing)

## Quick Start:

```bash
# Run advanced examples
./run-examples.sh

# Or run individual examples
cd component-references && ./reference-example.sh
cd localization && ./localization-example.sh
```

## Advanced Concepts Covered:

- **Component References**: Linking and managing component dependencies
- **Localization**: Environment-specific component adaptations
- **Complex Workflows**: Multi-stage component processing
- **Advanced Metadata**: Rich component descriptors and labels

## What you'll learn:

After completing these examples, you'll understand:
- How to create component dependency graphs
- Best practices for component references
- Techniques for environment-specific deployments
- Advanced OCM configuration patterns
