# Hello World Example

This example demonstrates creating a basic OCM component with a simple text resource.

## Overview

The Hello World example shows the fundamental OCM workflow:
- Creating a component descriptor
- Adding a simple text resource
- Building and publishing the component to a registry

## Files

- `create-component.sh` - Main script that creates the hello world component
- `work/hello.txt` - Simple text resource that gets packaged
- `work/component-descriptor.yaml` - Component metadata definition

## Running the Example

```bash
./create-component.sh
```

## What it demonstrates

- Basic OCM component structure
- Adding text-based resources
- Component descriptor configuration
- Publishing to a local registry

This is the simplest possible OCM component and serves as a good starting point for understanding OCM concepts.
